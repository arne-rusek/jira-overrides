# jira-overrides

Override various Jira layout troubles in Mayadata. This is a hack, you'd be probably better off not using it at all. I use it though.

- when browsing an issue, make the actual issue as wide as possible, remove useless padding and shrink metadata "bar"

# Install

## Firefox

Signed extension is in `jira-overrides/web-ext-artifacts`. Navigate to the folder with firefox (`file:///...` URL) and click on XPI file.

## Brave/Chrome

- navigate to `chrome://extensions`
- in upper right corner enable "developer mode"
- click on "Load Unpacked"
- navigate to the folder with `manifest.json`
- click ok :-)

# TODO

- Avoid having the binary extension in git
